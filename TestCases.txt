Test Categories & Sample Inputs

Test Case	Category	Test Input	Expected Behavior
1. Valid Input - Complete
| TC-001 | Full input, clear | "initialInput": "Write a JD for a Senior Python Developer in Boston with AWS, FastAPI experience" | Clarifier: No questions<br>JD is generated and refined |

2. Vague Inputs - Clarifier Trigger
| TC-002 | Only job title | "initialInput": "I need a backend developer" | Clarifier returns list of questions | | TC-003 | Only company type | "initialInput": "Hiring for a startup" | Clarifier asks role, tech stack, level | | TC-004 | Only seniority | "initialInput": "Looking for a senior person" | Clarifier asks for role and skills | | TC-005 | Colloquial | "initialInput": "We need help" | Clarifier identifies all missing info | | TC-006 | Minimal input | "initialInput": "Hiring" | Clarifier asks detailed questions |

3. Role-Specific Inputs
| TC-007 | Non-tech role | "initialInput": "pwd" | Generator builds HR-focused JD | | TC-008 | Creative role | "initialInput": "We need a graphic designer familiar with Figma and Adobe XD" | JD focuses on design tools, visual skills | | TC-009 | Leadership | "initialInput": "We are hiring a VP of Engineering for our SaaS company" | JD reflects executive responsibilities |

4. Remote & Location Testing
| TC-010 | Remote mention | "initialInput": "Remote software engineer with Python + Django experience" | JD includes remote work context | | TC-011 | Hybrid mention | "initialInput": "Hybrid data analyst in NYC" | JD includes location + hybrid details |

5. Input with Clarified Follow-Up Flow (Optional Extended Flow)
| TC-012 | Initial vague + clarified |
Step 1: "initialInput": "Looking for a developer" →
System: Returns clarifying questions
Step 2: Provide "React, Node.js, mid-level, remote" as follow-up
| Clarifier asks; system accepts second input and continues generation |

6. Edge Cases
| TC-013 | Over-specified | "initialInput": "JD for a Senior DevOps Engineer in London with Kubernetes, Terraform, GitHub Actions, AWS, Azure, GCP, monitoring tools, CI/CD, and cost optimization" | JD generator should summarize cleanly | | TC-014 | Very long paragraph | "initialInput": "We're a small but mighty fintech startup with unicorn dreams and limited budget but lots of passion, looking for someone who does front and backend and knows everything..." | Clarifier trims and asks what’s essential | | TC-015 | Misspelled input | "initialInput": "We ned a data engenieer" | System still understands intent and proceeds or asks clarifying questions |

7. Regression Tests
| TC-016 | Confirm no regressions | Use test inputs from TC-001 to TC-009 to verify refactoring doesn't break logic | All agents respond appropriately |

QA Recommendations
Use Postman or Swagger UI to test these manually.

Add unit tests or integration tests for:

Prompt clarity validation

Clarifier-agent branching logic

Consider logging LLM responses for auditing and debugging.
